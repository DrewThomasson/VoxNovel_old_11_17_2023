At the moment I've only got a local llama-2 instead of gpt-4 being given the speaker attribution task(who says what) in this
Its pretty bad at it, although but if you want to mess with it, here you go

**The whole point of this test was to see if i could get llama-2 running locally to do the job of speaker attribiution instead of giving it to gpt-4 making it completely free**
-unfortunatly it's areally bad at doing that job, I still havent solved this :/

**IMPORTANT**
-in order to run you need to do
`pip install -q ctransformers langchain`
